= Rack::CacheWhileRevalidate

== Idea

Often, for caching, you don't care if the data is a little stale, you're content to serve the stale data and silently revalidate the cache in the background.

== Usage

In your builder (or rackup or whatever), make sure you first off:
<tt>use Rack::Capabilities</tt>
 
Then, wherever your <tt>Rack::Cache</tt> usage occurs, put <tt>use Rack::CacheWhileRevalidate</tt> directly before it (NB). That's it!
